Add a function called add_inorder to listy.c (and make the necessary change to listy.h).
This function will add the provided node_t to the linked list in chronological order (ie, 
events with earlier start dates will be closer to the head of the list).

The function signature of add_inorder should look like this:

node_t * add_inorder(node_t *list, node_t *new)

Where list contains the address of the head of the list, and new contains the address
of the new node to add.

This function returns a pointer to the head of the list after the add is performed.

When add_inorder is correctly implemented, the following is
the expected output from ./lab8:

EVENT: 20190701T180000 20190701T230000 'Canada Day' 'Pat's plac'
EVENT: 20190706T120000 20190706T160000 'summary 1' 'location 1'
EVENT: 20190707T093000 20190707T102000 'uvwxyz 123' 'abcde 1234'
